    <h1>Freedom vs. Role</h1>
    <p>A Philosophical Reflection on Shooting an Elephant</p>
</header>

    <h2>Introduction: The Paradox of Power</h2>
    <p>
        In <strong>Shooting an Elephant</strong>, George Orwell explores a powerful paradox:
        Can someone with authority truly be free? Although Orwell holds political power 
        as a British officer in Burma, he reveals that power can destroy freedom rather 
        than protect it. This essay demonstrates that imperial authority creates a 
        psychological prison shaped by expectation, fear, and performance.

    <h2>What Does Freedom Mean?</h2>
    <div class="quote">
        “When the white man turns tyrant, it is his own freedom that he destroys.”
    </div>
    <p>
        In this quotation, freedom does not mean physical strength or legal power.
        Instead, it means moral autonomy — the ability to act according to one’s conscience.
        Orwell realizes that by participating in imperialism, he sacrifices his ability 
        to choose freely. He becomes trapped by the expectations of empire.
    </p>
    <p>
        This reveals that true freedom is internal. Without moral independence,
        authority becomes meaningless.
    </p>

    <h2>Social Expectation as a Prison</h2>
    <p>
        Orwell does not want to shoot the elephant once it becomes calm. However,
        thousands of Burmese spectators are watching him. He feels pressured 
        to perform his role as a decisive imperial officer.
    </p>
    <p>
        He admits he shoots the elephant simply to avoid looking foolish.
        This moment proves that public image controls his actions. 
        Although he appears powerful, he is psychologically enslaved.
    </p>

    <h2>Authority Without Freedom</h2>
    <p>
        Orwell carries a rifle and represents British law. Yet internally,
        he describes himself as a “hollow, posing dummy.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        This metaphor shows that he is no longer acting as an individual. 
        He is performing a role. The tyrant, therefore, becomes a slave 
        to his own image.
    </p>
    <p>
        The essay suggests that someone may possess authority while 
        lacking authentic freedom.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Freedom and the Meaning of Home</h2>
    <p>
        For a place to feel like home, a person must have autonomy, 
        authenticity, and emotional security. Orwell experiences none 
        of these in Burma. He is hated by the Burmese and conflicted 
        about his role in the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because he cannot act according to his true values, he feels 
        displaced. The essay ultimately argues that belonging requires 
        freedom. Without moral choice, identity collapses — and home 
        becomes impossible.
