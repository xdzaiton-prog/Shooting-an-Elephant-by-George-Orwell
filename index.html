        A philosophical exploration of moral autonomy, identity, and psychological imprisonment 
        in George Orwell’s <em>Shooting an Elephant</em>.

    <div class="card">
        <h2>What Does Freedom Mean?</h2>

        <p>
        In Orwell’s essay, freedom is not political dominance but moral autonomy — 
        the ability to act according to conscience rather than performance. 
        Although he holds a rifle and represents imperial authority, 
        he internally lacks choice.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
        “When the white man turns tyrant, it is his own freedom that he destroys.”
        </div>

        <p>
        Tyranny demands performance. Performance suppresses authenticity. 
        Once authenticity is suppressed, freedom collapses. 
        Orwell recognizes that imperialism does not only enslave the colonized; 
        it psychologically traps the colonizer in a permanent role.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="section-light" id="expectation">
    <div class="card">
        <h2>The Pressure of Public Expectation</h2>

        <p>
        The elephant is calm. Orwell knows it does not need to be killed. 
        Yet the presence of two thousand watching faces transforms his situation. 
        The crowd becomes an invisible authority.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
        “A sahib has got to act like a sahib.”
        </div>

        <p>
        At this moment, identity collapses into role. 
        He fears humiliation more than moral wrongdoing. 
        Social expectation becomes a form of violence — 
        forcing him to betray his own ethical judgment.
        </p>

<section id="paradox">
    <div class="card">
        <h2>The Power Paradox</h2>

        <p>
        Outwardly, Orwell holds authority. Inwardly, he is manipulated.
        His realization that he is controlled by the crowd reveals the paradox of imperialism:
        the ruler is ruled.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
        “I was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those faces behind.”
        </div>

        <p>
        Authority without freedom is psychological imprisonment. 
        Imperial power requires constant proof of dominance, 
        leaving no room for moral hesitation. 
        The role of Empire becomes a mask that slowly replaces the self.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="section-light" id="home">
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Why Freedom Is Necessary for Home</h2>

        <p>
        Home requires belonging. Belonging requires authenticity. 
        Authenticity requires freedom.
        </p>

        <p>
        Orwell belongs nowhere. He is hated by the Burmese, 
        yet emotionally detached from the Empire. 
        Because he must constantly perform authority, 
        he cannot exist as his true self.
        </p>

        <p>
        A place cannot feel like home when identity is reduced to performance. 
        Without freedom, there is no authentic self. 
        Without self, there is no belonging.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Reflection</h3>

        <p>
        By shooting the elephant simply to avoid humiliation, 
        Orwell demonstrates the tragic irony of power:
        domination destroys the dominator. 
        Tyranny becomes self-imprisonment, 
        and in losing his freedom, he loses the possibility of home.
